Creating new commands, event handlers, and keywords is pretty simple.  
We have interfaces for all of them, you only need to implement them to start creating a new one.  
See [the test file](src/slashcommands/Test.ts) for basic slash command structure.

You'll probably want to build the bot at least once after you clone it, before you start working on it.  
It's not necessary, but your linter may complain about missing files that the build script compiles.
